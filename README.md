# Surfs Up
Module 9 - Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval


# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
To ensure the success of the business, Wave and Icecream, our investory W. Avy would like to review the temperature statistics for June and December for Oahu.    Reviewing these months will ensure a successful year round business for our icecream and surf shop.

# Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. 
Below are the summary statistics for both June and December.

Key Statistics
- For our analysis, there were 1,700 temperatures reviewed for June and 1,517 temperatures reviewed for December.
- June saw an average temperature of 74.9 and December recorded an average of 71.04.
- The lowest temperature in June was 64.0.   The highest temperature in June was 85.0.
- The lowest temperature in December was 56.0.   The highest temperature in December was 83.0.

# Summary: 
Overall, it can be determined that Wave and Icecream would have a successful year round buisness.   Even with a low temperature in December of 56 degrees, the lowest 25% quartile was still averaging 69 degrees.    This weather would be warm enough to support the buisness.   Further supporting this is the fact that the average temperatures only differed by 2 degrees.   That shows that the temperatures in Oahu would be stable.

# Further Analysis
Before venturing into our buisness, some more analysis can be done to further support the success of the buisness. 

- Precipitation:  Our previous analysis on precipitation only included one year.    To be more through in our research, the analysis should go back several years.   This will ensure that we are not looking at one year that may be an anomaly.   Precipitation greatly influences the purchase of ice-cream and surf rentals and could harm our business if the information is not complete.

- Severe Weather:   Unfortunately, Hawaii being a tropical location can also bring severe weather in the form of tropical cyclones.   These can include hurricanes and severe tropical storms.    Using other external data sources, an analyis shoudl be done on the frequency of these storms and their impact in the Oahu area.

- Wind:   Wind can be a factor in not only surfing but could effect the number of tourists.    A high wind could make the waves difficult and therefore decrease revenue for rentals.    It could also discourage tourists from venturing outside to enjoy icecream.   It is recommended that an analysis be done on the wind speeds in the area to see if the winds would be a contributing factor to the success of the company.
